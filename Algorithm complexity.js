Complexity considers how the algorithm scales with a change in input size.


LINEAR COMPLEXITY GROWTH:
In a simple for loop, where we run from i = 0 to i = array.length,
the number of iterations is one-to-one  with the number of elements.

With linear growth, the algorithm is just a little slower than the addition algorithm.




COMPARING ALGORITHMS:
Algorithms are only comparable if they share a common input and output.
So  add(x, y) and  running_sum(array)  are not comparable.

Decorator Pattern,  if you need to have many variations of your class, to avoid class explosion, you instead create decorators that wrap a base case (or another decorator), you can have many variations of your class by wrapping it in many decorators.

Learn the patterns (Strategy pattern, Visitor Pattern and Factory pattern are all very common), but a warning
It's a common mistake when people learn these they start applying them everywhere
These patterns tend to increase the complexity of the design and so need be used selectively
